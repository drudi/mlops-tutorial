# Deploy to a cloud provider other than Azure or GCP 🚀

Here are some steps to get you started with deploying your container to a cloud provider other than Azure or GCP.

## Deploy through UI 💻

Exercises:
- For your specific cloud provider, find a service that allows you to deploy a container as a service.
- Configure the service to pull our image from dockerhub.
- Deploy the service.
- Try out the service by accessing the URL that was generated for you.
- Let your neighbour also try to access your app! 🎉
- Clean up the resources

## Deploy using the CLI 🧑‍💻

Exercises:
- Install the command line interface (CLI) for your cloud provider
- Configure the CLI (e.g. login to your account)
- Find the command to deploy a container as a service
- Try and access the app the same way as before 🎉
- Clean up the resources
